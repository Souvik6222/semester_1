    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

    <hr>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The history of computing is far older than most imagine, starting not with electronics but with <b>mechanical devices</b>. 
        Ancient tools like the abacus were humanity's first attempt at automated calculation. However, the true conceptual leap came in the 19th century with Charles Babbage. 
        He designed the <u>Analytical Engine</u>, a machine that, while never fully built in his lifetime, is considered the <strong>first blueprint for a general-purpose, programmable computer</strong>. 
        It included concepts like an <q>Arithmetic Logic Unit</q> and integrated memory, ideas that are <em>foundational</em> to every computer we use today. It was a truly <i>revolutionary</i> concept.

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <p>
        The evolution from room-sized mechanical giants to pocket-sized devices is often categorized into generations, each marked by a major technological shift. 
        The 1st generation (1940s-1950s) used bulky and unreliable <mark>vacuum tubes</mark> for circuitry. 
        The 2nd generation introduced <i>transistors</i>, which were smaller, faster, and more reliable. 
        The 3rd generation's breakthrough was the integrated circuit, putting many transistors onto a single silicon chip. 
        Finally, the 4th generation brought the microprocessor, putting the entire <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> onto one chip, which led to the era of <b>personal computers</b>. This miniaturization made computing <em>accessible to everyone</em>.

    <h3>Mathematics and Logic</h3>
    <p>
        At their core, computers are powerful mathematical machines. They perform complex calculations based on binary logic. 
        Even abstract concepts are broken down into numbers. This power allows them to model everything, from the universe's most famous equation, E = mc<sup>2</sup>, to the simple chemical structure of water, H<sub>2</sub>O. The processing power is often measured in calculations per second, like 10<sup>9</sup>, and data is stored in units like K<sub>B</sub>.

    <h2>The Birth of the Internet</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet's origins lie in a project called <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr>, funded by the U.S. military in the 1960s. 
        The goal was to create a <u>decentralized network</u> that could withstand a partial outage. 
        It wasn't until the invention of the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 that the internet transformed into the user-friendly, interconnected web of information we know today. 
        His vision was not just about technology but about universal access, a principle he captured perfectly.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."</p>
        - <cite>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</cite>

    <h2>The Modern Era and Web Evolution</h2>
    <p>
        In the early days, internet access was a slow and noisy affair using <del>dial-up modems</del>. Today, we enjoy instant connectivity through <ins>high-speed broadband</ins> and fiber optics. 
        The web itself has evolved from static pages of text to dynamic, interactive applications. We've moved from Web 1.0 (read-only) to Web 2.0 (read-write/social) and are now entering Web 3.0, which promises a more decentralized and intelligent web. 
        This rapid progress means that today's powerful computers can now fit into our <small>pockets as smartphones</small>, connecting billions of people worldwide. The change has been <strong>truly transformative</strong>.

    <h2>Programming and User Interaction</h2>
    <p>
        Communicating with computers requires specific languages. To create a simple webpage, a developer writes instructions using a language like <mark>HTML</mark>. For example, the code <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;</code> tells the browser to display a paragraph. 
        The user, in turn, interacts with the computer through commands. To copy text, you might press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>. The system then provides feedback, perhaps showing a message like <samp>Item copied successfully</samp>. When writing a program, you might define a variable like <var>userAge</var> to store information.

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

    <hr>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Souvik. I am currently learning the fundamentals of web development.<br> 
        I find building things for the web <b>incredibly rewarding</b> and I'm excited to see what I can create.
    </p>

    <p>
        My hobbies include <i>reading science fiction novels</i>, <u>playing strategy games</u>, and 
        <mark>exploring new hiking trails</mark>. I'm also a big fan of chemistry, my favorite molecule is H<sub>2</sub>O! My goal is to hike my 10<sup>th</sup> mountain this year.
    </p>

    <p>
        My primary goal is to become a full-stack developer within the next two years.<br>
        I am eager to learn both front-end and back-end technologies to build complete and functional web applications.

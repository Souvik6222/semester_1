    <h1>The Pink City: Jaipur</h1>

    <p>
        Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, is famously known as the "Pink City" due to the distinctive color of its buildings. 
        The city was painted pink in 1876 to welcome the Prince of Wales and has retained its rosy hue ever since.

        The city is home to stunning forts and palaces. The most famous is Hawa Mahal, or the "Palace of Winds," with its intricate facade of 953 windows. 
        City Palace, a blend of Rajput and Mughal architecture, is another major attraction, offering a glimpse into the opulent lifestyle of the former royal family.

        Beyond the palaces, Jaipur is a paradise for food lovers and shoppers. 
        You can savor delicious Rajasthani cuisine like Dal Baati Churma and browse the bustling bazaars for textiles, jewelry, and handicrafts. 
        The rich culture and heritage make Jaipur a jewel of India.

    <h1>Exploring Delhi</h1>

    <p>
        Delhi, the capital city of India, is a massive metropolitan area in the countryâ€™s north. 
        It's a city of contrasts, where ancient history coexists with a vibrant, modern culture. 
        The city is divided into two parts: Old Delhi, with its narrow lanes and historic mosques and forts, and New Delhi, a planned city of wide avenues and imposing government buildings.

        One of the most famous landmarks is the Red Fort, a 17th-century Mughal fortress that was the main residence of the emperors. 
        Another must-visit is India Gate, a war memorial dedicated to the troops of British India who died in wars fought between 1914 and 1919. 
        For a taste of local life, a visit to Chandni Chowk for its street food is an absolute must.

        The city's rich history is also reflected in its numerous tombs and monuments, including Humayun's Tomb and the Qutub Minar, a towering minaret. 
        Delhi's blend of history, culture, and modernity makes it a fascinating destination for any traveler.
